This concludes our optimization chapter. We have used ETS as a cache mechanism
where reads can happen from nay processes but writes are still srealized through a 
single process. More importantly, we have also learned that once data can be read asynchronously,
we need to be aware of the race conditions it might introduce.

In practice, if you find yourself in a position where you need a process registry for dynamic processes,
you should use the Registry module(:( >:())) provided as part of Elixir.
